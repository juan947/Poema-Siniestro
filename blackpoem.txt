Not so sinister poem

The sky is black
The flowers are black
My soul is black
My dog is black

My hair is black
My horse is black
the night is black
nelson mandela is black
life is dark

Generals gathered at their masses,
Just like witches at black masses,
Rabbit minds that plot destruction,
Sorcerers of death's construction.

Oh Yeah!

But the rainbow is still full of colors.
And FIME is green.

The end
